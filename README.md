# red-sox-algos

Dumb algorithms to predict Red Sox wins

- [Coin Toss](https://github.com/timdotbiz/red-sox-algos/tree/main/coin-toss)
- [Mascot Ferocity](https://github.com/timdotbiz/red-sox-algos/tree/main/mascot-ferocity)

## TO DO:

- build a task runner than 1) runs each of the algorithms on a game day, 2) compares the algorithms' preditions to the actual results and records their success rate
- learn how packages work in python so I can create a set of common classes (player, team, game, season, etc.)
